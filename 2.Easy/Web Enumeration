1.Introduction

Connect to the network with openvpn or use a attack box of tryhackme.

2.Manual Enumeration

Using our Browsers Developer Console
Modern-day browsers including Chrome and Firefox have a suite of tools located in the "Developer Tools/Console". We're going to be discussing Firefox's, however,
Chrome has a very similar suite. This suite includes a range of tools including:

Viewing page source code
Finding assets
Debugging & executing code such as javascript on the client-side (our Browser)

Using "F12" on our keyboard, this is a shortcut to launch this suite of tools. We can search manually over the website with the dev tools and maybe we have luck a find
something.

3.Introduction to Gobuster 

Gobuster is already installed on Kali Linux else go on the following link and follow the instruction there : https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

Useful Global Flags

There are some useful Global flags that can be used as well. I've included them in the table below. You can review these in the main documentation as well - here.

Flag	Long Flag	Description
-t	--threads	Number of concurrent threads (default 10)
-v	--verbose	Verbose output
-z	--no-progress	Don't display progress
-q	--quiet	Don't print the banner and other noise
-o	--output	Output file to write results to

I will typically change the number of threads to 64 to increase the speed of my scans. If you don't change the number of threads, Gobuster can be a little slow.

4.Gobuster Modes

Using "dir" Mode
To use "dir" mode, you start by typing gobuster dir. This isn't the full command, but just the start. This tells Gobuster that you want to perform a directory search,
instead of one of its other methods (which we'll get to). It has to be written like this or else Gobuster will complain. After that, you will need to add the URL and 
wordlist using the -u and -w options, respectively. Like so:

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

more useful flags/options under https://github.com/OJ/gobuster#dir-mode-options

some of the more commong flags/options

Flag	Long Flag	Description
-c	--cookies	Cookies to use for requests
-x	--extensions	File extension(s) to search for
-H	--headers	Specify HTTP headers, -H 'Header1: val1' -H 'Header2: val2'
-k	--no-tls-validation	Skip TLS certificate verification
-n	--no-status	Don't print status codes
-P	--password	Password for Basic Auth
-s	--status-codes	Positive status codes
-b	--status-codes-blacklist	Negative status codes
-U	--username	Username for Basic Auth


x is a useful flag/option to get some extensions
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.252.123/myfolder -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x.html,.css,.js,.txt,.conf

use -k to skip the cert in a Https website else it not gonna work probably at all and show probably nothing.This flag can be used with "dir" mode and "vhost" modes.

"dns" Mode

The next mode we'll focus on is the "dns" mode. This allows Gobuster to brute-force subdomains. During a penetration test (or capture the flag), it's important to check 
sub-domains of your target's top domain. Just because something is patched in the regular domain, does not mean it is patched in the sub-domain. There may be a vulnerability
for you to exploit in one of these sub-domains. For example, if State Farm owns statefarm.com and mobile.statefarm.com, there may be a hole in mobile.statefarm.com that is 
not present in statefarm.com. This is why it is important to search for subdomains too!

-d and -w are the main flags that you'll need for most of your scans. But there are a few others that are worth mentioning that we can go over. They are in the table below.
Flag	Long Flag	Description
-c	--show-cname	Show CNAME Records (cannot be used with '-i' option)
-i	--show-ips	Show IP Addresses
-r	--resolver	Use custom DNS server (format server.com or server.com:port)

more infos under https://github.com/OJ/gobuster#dns-mode-help

example command
gobuster dns -d mydomain.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt

"vhost" Mode

The last and final mode we'll focus on is the "vhost" mode. This allows Gobuster to brute-force virtual hosts. Virtual hosts are different websites on the same machine. In 
some instances, they can appear to look like sub-domains, but don't be deceived! Virtual Hosts are IP based and are running on the same server. This is not usually apparent
to the end-user. On an engagement, it may be worthwhile to just run Gobuster in this mode to see if it comes up with anything. You never know, it might just find something!
While participating in rooms on TryHackMe, virtual hosts would be a good way to hide a completely different website if nothing turned up on your main port 80/443 scan.

Using "vhost" Mode
To use "vhost" mode, you start by typing gobuster vhost. Just like the other modes, this isn't the full command, but just the start. This tells Gobuster that you want to
perform a virtual host brute-force, instead of one of the other methods as previously mentioned. It has to be written like this or else Gobuster will complain. After that, 
you will need to add the domain and wordlist using the -u and -w options, respectively. Like so:

gobuster vhost -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt

5.Useful Wordlists

Kali Linux Default Lists

Below you will find a useful list of wordlists that are installed on Kali Linux by default. This is as of the latest version at the time of writing which is 2020.3.
Anything with a wildcard (*) character indicates there's more than one list that matches. Keep in mind, a lot of these can be interchanged between modes. For example, 
"dir" mode wordlists (such as ones from the dirbuster directory) will contain words like "admin", "index", "about", "events", etc. A lot of these could be subdomains as well.
Give them a try with the different modes!

    /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-*.txt
    /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
    /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
    /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
    /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
    /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/extensions_common.txt - Useful for when fuzzing for files!

Non-Standard Lists

In addition to the above, Daniel Miessler has created an amazing GitHub repo called SecLists. It compiles many different lists used for many different things. 
The best part is, it's in apt! You can sudo apt install seclists and get the entire repo! We won't dive into any other lists as there are many. However, between what's 
installed by default on Kali and the SecLists repo, I doubt you'll need anything else.

6.Practical: Gobuster(Deploy #1)

Okay lets start with the practical stuff first we have to change the hosts file in the /etc/hosts , i would recommend to sudo nano /etc/hosts and then to add the values
and to save it.When u gonna try to change/add values in the folder you cant do it, because it has a write protection.

x.x.x.x=machine_ip

The echo method didnt work for me and i used sudo nano instead.

You will also need to add "webenum.thm" to your /etc/hosts file to start off with like so:
echo "x.x.x.x webenum.thm" >> /etc/hosts

You will also need to add any virtual hosts that you discover through the same way, before you can visit them in your browser i.e.:
echo "x.x.x.x mysubdomain.webenum.thm" >> /etc/hosts

I started with gobuster to get some directories
gobuster dir -u http://x.x.x.x -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

For the second question you could make a new command with the -x flag/options and so on or what i did is open the website x.x.x.x/Changes and then i looked up the extensions.
The third question is to find a flag, i looked up in the directories if i could find something and i did find it under x.x.x.x/VIDEO/flag.php

The vhost mode is the next i used, gobuster vhost -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
You have to check if the directory is correct, by me i had to change it from SecLists to seclists and then it worked.
