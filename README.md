# TryHackMe
Walkthroughs of the rooms i completed.<br>
They are categorised in the different difficulties.<br>
Under Misc i added the file Summary to write in which order i took the different rooms.<br>
The writeups of the rooms gonna have the answers so be aware that it maybe spoils someone.<br>
I gonna summarize the rooms sometimes in less or more detail depending on my time and if i feel its necessary as a summary for myself.<br>
The writeups gonna have copied text of Tryhackme when i think it is necessary for my self that when i read it again that i can understand what i did before.

I gonna try to do every day 1 new room or more and to catch up with the writeups of the rooms i already have done, depending on how much time i have, but i guess depending on the difficulty maybe i gonna need more time.

If u find something that is wrong make a pull request and i gonna revalue my text.<br>
Thanks in advance.
