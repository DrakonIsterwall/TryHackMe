In this Room of TryHackMe we talk about the CVE-2019-14287.
The vulnerability in this is a older version of sudo <1.8.28, yeah 2019 but you never know if it could appear on your journey.

The sudo command allows you to execute the command you wanna use as an another user.Normally it defaults to user 0 (root) but then you need to know the password of root.
The vulnerability here is that we use the UID -1 and this falls back to the user root.
You get root access then and can change everything.This will only work if you got non-root sudo permission for a command.

1. Deploy!
Deploy the machine by clicking on start machine.

2. Security Bypass
ssh into the target machine with the IP you are given and the credentials that are given. Username here is tryhackme and the password is tryhackme.

ssh -p 2222 tryhackme@machine_ip

After u ssh'ed into the machine type sudo -l. You will get to know u can run bash as sudo.

Answer : /bin/bash

Use the command sudo -u#-1 bash and then cat /root/root.txt
