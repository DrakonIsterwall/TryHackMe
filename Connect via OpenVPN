Im using Kali Linux and i moved the downloaded yourusername.ovpn file to my /home/yourusername/Desktop/ 
I strongly suggest you use Kali Linux or something similiar with all the programs added like john,enum4linux and so on or else you
have to add them yourself,because many of the rooms in TryHackMe need them to be solved.

With the following command (if u are not root,else no sudo needed) you can connect then to TryHackMe and then you are in the same Network as the Machines u want to attack.
You can check it if u can ping 10.10.10.10 then your connection is working.

sudo openvpn yourusername.ovpn
