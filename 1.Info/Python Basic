2.Hello World
In every language the hello world is probably the first command you get to know and in python its pretty easy.This is for python3.
print("Hello World)

Answer:THM{PRINT_STATEMENTS}

3.Mathematical Operators
print(21+43)
print(142-52)
print(10*342)
print(5**5)

Answer:THM{ADDITI0N},THM{SUBTRCT},THM{MULTIPLICATION_PYTHON},THM{EXP0N3NT_POWER}

4.Variables and Data Types
height = 200
height += 50
print(height)

Answer:THM{VARIABL3S}

5.Logical and Boolean Operators

Its about true and false comparison like in many languages with == or != or < or > or <= or >=

6.Introduction to If Statements

We have to follow the instruction in the view site shipping.py

customer_basket_cost = 34
customer_basket_weight = 44
customer_shipping_cost = 0
# Write if statement here to calculate the total cost
if customer_basket_cost > 100:
  customer_shipping_cost=0
else:
  customer_shipping_cost = customer_basket_weight *1.2

total_basket_cost= customer_basket_cost + customer_shipping_cost
print(total_basket_cost)

Result is 86.8 and when we change the customer_basket_cost to 101 the result is 101

7.Loops
Print in a loop up to 50
for x in range (51):
  print(x)

Answer:THM{L00PS_WHILE_FOR}

8.Introductions to Functions

This is the code that Tryhackme gave me after i had to think what they want from me.
investment_in_bitcoin = 1.2
bitcoin_to_usd = 40000

# 1) write a function to calculate bitcoin to usd
def bitcoinToUSD(bitcoin_amount,bitcoin_value_usd):
  usd_value = bitcoin_amount*bitcoin_value_usd
  return usd_value

investment_in_usd = bitcoinToUSD(investment_in_bitcoin, bitcoin_to_usd)
if investment_in_usd <= 30000:
  print("Investment below $30,000! SELL!")
else:
  print("Investment above $30,000")

The code i came up with and does the same in less code is this:

investment_in_bitcoin = 0.7
bitcoin_to_usd = 40000

def bitcoin(investment_in_bitcoin,bitcoin_to_usd):
    if investment_in_bitcoin*bitcoin_to_usd >=30000:
       print("Your investment is over or equal to 30000")
    else:
       print("Your investment is under 30000")

bitcoin(investment_in_bitcoin,bitcoin_to_usd)

So you see there are more ways to the result but for the Answer/Flag use the way above else it doesnt work i guess because
you have to call the function bitcoinToUSD.

I already see that my own studying of python (my repo python_course) paid of in this case since i found a solution 
on my own without the need of help.

9.Files

You define a variable with the open command so you can open a file in this case with r so read only and then u print the 
flag.txt. You can open a file with w and then use f.write("") and f.close() if u wanna write something into a file but then u 
overwrite the file with with open and then a you append and add your text to the end of the existing file.

f = open("flag.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

10.Imports

Many libraries are already built in into python but when u wanna add libraries you need to use pip.
If pip is not already installed use the command below.
apt install pip

At the end of this room i probably would put this into Easy difficulty and not into Info in my opinion since it requires some
training/practice when u have never done programming.But its doable.
