1.Introduction

Start the machine and in this room we gonna learn more about the Repeater Module.
If u didnt work with BurpSuite before i recommend you to complete the Burpsuite Basic room since it has some configs you gonna need.

2.What is Repeater?


In essence, Burp Suite Repeater enables us to modify and resend intercepted requests to a target of our choosing. It allows us to take requests captured in the Burp Proxy and
manipulate them, sending them repeatedly as needed. Alternatively, we can manually create requests from scratch, similar to using a command-line tool like cURL.


Request List: Located at the top left of the tab, it displays the list of Repeater requests. Multiple requests can be managed simultaneously, and each new request sent to 
Repeater will appear here.

Request Controls: Positioned directly beneath the request list, these controls allow us to send a request, cancel a hanging request, and navigate through the request history.

Request and Response View: Occupying the majority of the interface, this section displays the Request and Response views. We can edit the request in the Request view and then
forward it, while the corresponding response will be shown in the Response view.

Layout Options: Located at the top-right of the Request/Response view, these options enable us to customize the layout of the Request and Response views. The default setting 
is a side-by-side (horizontal) layout, but we can also choose a vertical layout or combine them in separate tabs.

Inspector: Positioned on the right-hand side, the Inspector allows us to analyze and modify requests in a more intuitive manner than using the raw editor. We will explore 
this feature in a later task.

Target: Situated above the Inspector, the Target field specifies the IP address or domain to which the requests are sent. When requests are sent to Repeater from other 
Burp Suite components, this field is automatically populated.

3.Basic Usage

Once a request has been captured in the Proxy module, we can send it to Repeater by either right-clicking on the request and selecting Send to Repeater, or by utilizing 
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + R.
Thats where the magic happens we get the Request we want to our Repeater module.First we send it to get a Response then we modify our Request to achieve something that could
us let into some area of a website where we maybe dont belong.Dont forget the history buttons (looks like left and right,they are on the right site of the Send button) with that
we can look through our different modifications.
