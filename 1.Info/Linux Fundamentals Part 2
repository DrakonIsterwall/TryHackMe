1.Introduction

2.Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy)
Accessing the Machine with ssh with the ip adress of the remote machine and username (here tryhackme) and password(tryhackme)

ssh tryhackme@machine_ip

3.Introduction to Flags and Switches
The explanation of the comman man explained on the command ls. It helps a lot to get to know what flags -x you can use with a 
command.

Answer:down,-h

4.Filesystem Interaction Continued

In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:

    create files and folders
    move files and folders
    delete files and folders

Here we see the commands touch (create a file),mkdir(create/make a directory),cp(copy file or folder),
mv(move a file or folder),rm(remove a file or folder),file(determine the file type)

Answer:touch newnote,ASCII text,mv myfile myfolder,THM{FILESYSTEM}

5.Permissions101

With ls -lh you can see your permissions on the files.
With su we can switch users.

Files/Folders can have different permissions,that means a user can maybe read a file but not write on it or can write and read it
but can not execute it.

with su -l username we can drop into a new shell with the home directory of the user instead of continuing to use the directory
of the previous user.

Answer:user2,su user2,THM{SU_USER2}

6.Common Directories

We get to know the folders /etc,/var,/root,/tmp

/etc (sudoers file and more)
This root directory is one of the most important root directories on your system. The etc folder (short for etcetera) is a 
commonplace location to store system files that are used by your operating system. 
For example, the sudoers file highlighted in the screenshot below contains a list of the users & groups that have permission 
to run sudo or a set of commands as the root user.
Also highlighted below are the "passwd" and "shadow" files. These two files are special for Linux as they show how your 
system stores the passwords for each user in encrypted formatting called sha512.

/var (good for logfiles of services)
The "/var" directory, with "var" being short for variable data,  is one of the main root folders found on a Linux install. 
This folder stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system. For example, 
log files from running services and applications are written here (/var/log), or other data that is not necessarily associated 
with a specific user (i.e., databases and the like).

/root (Maybe important data of root saved here)
Unlike the /home directory, the /root folder is actually the home for the "root" system user. There isn't anything more 
to this folder other than just understanding that this is the home directory for the "root" user. 
But, it is worth a mention as the logical presumption is that this user would have their data in a directory such 
as "/home/root" by default.  

/tmp (important folder for Pentesting)
This is a unique root directory found on a Linux install. Short for "temporary", the /tmp directory is volatile 
and is used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Similar to the memory on your computer, 
once the computer is restarted, the contents of this folder are cleared out.hat's useful for us in pentesting is 
that any user can write to this folder by default. Meaning once we have access to a machine, Wit serves as a good place
to store things like our enumeration scripts.

Answer:/var/log,/tmp,/root
