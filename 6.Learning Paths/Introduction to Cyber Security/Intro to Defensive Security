Second Room of Learning Path:Introduction to Cyber Security

1.Introduction to Defensive Security

Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:

Preventing intrusions from occurring
Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
In this room, we cover:

Security Operations Center (SOC)
Threat Intelligence
Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
Malware Analysis

Answer:Blue Team

2.Areas of Defensive Security

Read system logs,read network logs.Look if the file system had major changes like installed programs, created files, partially
overwritten files, and deleted files.Check the System Memory/RAM if something is loaded in that looks suspicious.

Learning about your adversaries(the guy who wanna hack our costumer) allows you to know their tactics, techniques, and procedures.
As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary/they guy/guys that wanna hack our costumer), 
predict their activity, and consequently,we will be able to mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.

The four major phases of the incident response process are:

Preparation: This requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents. Ideally, various measures are put in place to prevent
incidents from happening in the first place.

Detection and Analysis: The team has the necessary resources to detect any incident; moreover, it is essential to further 
analyze any detected incident to learn about its severity.

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from affecting other systems, 
eliminate it, and recover the affected systems. For instance, when we notice that a system is infected with a computer virus,
we would like to stop (contain) the virus from spreading to other systems, clean (eradicate) the virus, and ensure proper
system recovery.

Post-Incident Activity: After successful recovery, a report is produced, and the learned lesson is shared to prevent 
similar future incidents.

3.Practical Example of Defensive Security

Click on the View Site

In this simple example you check logs of a SIEM system to see who is the intruder and then mail/inform the SOC Leader.
He gives you the permission to add the IP to the firewall's block list.With this you blocked out the Intruder for now.
