1.Introduction

The idea of this room is to get to know that you have to research a lot of stuff in this field and that you cant know everything.

We will be looking at the following topics:
• An example of a research question
• Vulnerability Searching tools
• Linux Manual Pages

2.Example Research Question

Read the examples and try to get some ideas how you can search for solutions to your questions.
When you are already working long in the field you probably have your search routines like when you work in the sales department,
then you know where to get to know new costumers, maybe on new events or after partys or some seminars or similiar stuff.
In the field of buying hardware you maybe found out how to optimize your search engine to find the best deals and so on.

Here we try to open our mind and think how we can approach a problem or when we see something new like in the example you see a 
website when you are doing a CTF or you found out with nmap that they using an old version of an apache service , can i maybe find an 
exploit that i can use that on ?Its like collecting informations on different subjects and then use a filter (maybe programmed,maybe 
your own experience) the informations to find a solution. After some time you can revaluate your searches and look if u maybe can find
like more efficient ways to search like as example google dorking to get a refined search.

Answer:Repeat,NTLM,Cron Jobs,Base 16,sha512crypt

3.Vulnerabilty Researching

look for vulnerabilitys with searchsploit for example ( or use the website ExploitDatabase)
searchsploit fuel cms

Answers:CVE-2020-10385,CVE-2016-1240,CVE-2007-0017,CVE-2019-18634

4.Manual Pages

Manual Pages are great to explain a lot of tools. We had this topic already in the Linux Fundamental Rooms and it is pretty important,
because you always gonna find some new tools that you maybe dont understand full and you want some in depth information.

we had examples like man ssh,man nmap,man ls,man scp and so on. Some man pages are written well like on the well known basic tools and on some
lets say experimental tool it can happen that we dont have a man page.

Answer:-r,-l,-B,nc -l -p 12345

5.Final Thoughts

They recommend the next room that is google dorking. When you are looking up informations in general like if someone tells you the 
earth is flat ( just an example and yes the earth is round , believe me i know it i worked in enough fields in my live that i can
swear on it, so dont believe some crazy people :D, but back to topic now) and then you wanna prove for yourself if it is really flat
or round (its round) then you gonna google and you gonna see some people say yes its flat and some people say its round, so you have
controversial informations(its round). In our field we have a lot of security researchers,black hats,white hats,grey hats and many 
more that are having blogs or explaining software and mostly people dont make the effort in this field to spread missinformation
because it has not much benefit to them unless they trolling hard.
