1.Introduction

This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on the vulnerabilities, how they occur, and how you can exploit them.
You will put the theory into practice by completing supporting challenges.

    Broken Access Control
    Cryptographic Failures
    Injection
    Insecure Design
    Security Misconfiguration
    Vulnerable and Outdated Components
    Identification and Authentication Failures
    Software and Data Integrity Failures
    Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
    Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The room has been designed for beginners and assumes no previous security knowledge.
