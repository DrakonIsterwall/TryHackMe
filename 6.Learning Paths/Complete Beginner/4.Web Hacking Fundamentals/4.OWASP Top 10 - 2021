1.Introduction

This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on the vulnerabilities, how they occur, and how you can exploit them.
You will put the theory into practice by completing supporting challenges.

    Broken Access Control
    Cryptographic Failures
    Injection
    Insecure Design
    Security Misconfiguration
    Vulnerable and Outdated Components
    Identification and Authentication Failures
    Software and Data Integrity Failures
    Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
    Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The room has been designed for beginners and assumes no previous security knowledge.

2.Accessing Machines

Start machine and connect your OpenVPN.

3.Broken Access Control

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:

    Being able to view sensitive information from other users
    Accessing unauthorized functionality

Simply put, broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorisation, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks 
they aren't supposed to.

4.Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge)

Insecure direct object references (IDOR)

Log into the http://machine_ip with the noot and test1234 and change the id in the url to 0 and get the flag.

5.Cryptographic Failures

The example here is emails:

When you are accessing your email account using your browser, you want to be sure that the communications between you and the
server are encrypted. That way, any eavesdropper trying to capture your network packets won't be able to recover the content of 
your email addresses. When we encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as encrypting 
data in transit.
Since your emails are stored in some server managed by your provider, it is also desirable that the email provider can't read 
their client's emails. To this end, your emails might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as 
encrypting data at rest.

At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as 
"Man in The Middle Attacks", whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control. Then, they would 
take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted 
in the first place). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps that can be 
exploited without advanced networking knowledge. Indeed, in some cases, the sensitive data can be found directly on the web 
server itself.
