1.Open for business!

It recommends that we do the rooms Burpsuite Basics and Burpsuite Repeater before.We already did the Burpsuite Basics before, i 
gonna add the Burpsuite Repeater room under the Difficulty Info.Okay then lets continue.

2.Let’s go on an adventure!

Click your way thorugh the website to get familiar with it.

Follow the instructions then you get the answers nothin special here.

3.Inject the juice

We use ' or 1=1-- for the login email and type in any password and try to login.

Why does this work?

The character ' will close the brackets in the SQL query
'OR' in a SQL statement will return true if either side of it is true. As 1=1 is always true, the whole statement is true. Thus it will tell the server that the email is 
valid, and log us into user id 0, which happens to be the administrator account.
The -- character is used in SQL to comment out data, any restrictions on the login will no longer work as they are interpreted as a comment. 
This is like the # and // comment in python and javascript respectively.

Similar to what we did in Question #1, we will now log into Bender's account! Capture the login request again, but this time we will put: bender@juice-sh.op'-- as the email. 

But why don't we put the 1=1?

Well, as the email address is valid (which will return true), we do not need to force it to be true. Thus we are able to use '-- to bypass the login system. 
Note the 1=1 can be used when the email or username is not known or invalid.

4.Who broke my lock?!

We intercept again a login try and change the email to the admin login.We can change the password to §§ thats like a placeholder for the brutceforceattack because we wanna
get the password of the admin account.Change the values to this before we start the attack {"email":"admin@juice-sh.op","password":"§§"}
I installed seclist with : sudo apt install seclists 
Under payload,payload settings (simple list) we gonna add the following list : /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt

After we started the attack we need to wait till we get a 200 response so we know this password works.With the password that we got we can finally login as the admin.

The next thing is we wanna change the password of jim , we are given the informations that his email is jim@juice-sh.op
We use the security question to reset the password mostly we would try something easy like what is the favorite color or a zip code or something similiar.
Follow the instruction and change jims password.

5.AH! Don’t look!

Follow the instructions to find the ftp and then download the files and get back to the home page to get the flag.
Dont have an idea what the mcsafesearch mr noodles thing.Log in with the data an get the flag.

To get around this, we will use a character bypass called "Poison Null Byte". A Poison Null Byte looks like this: %00. 

Note: as we can download it using the url, we will need to encode this into a url encoded format.

The Poison Null Byte will now look like this: %2500. Adding this and then a .md to the end will bypass the 403 error!

Why does this work? 

A Poison Null Byte is actually a NULL terminator. By placing a NULL character in the string at a certain byte, the string will tell the server to terminate at that point, 
nulling the rest of the string.

6.Who’s flying this thing?

When Broken Access Control exploits or bugs are found, it will be categorised into one of two types:

Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Occurs when a user can perform an action or access data of another user with the same level of permissions.

Vertical Privilege Escalation
Occurs when a user can perform an action or access data of another user with a higher level of permissions.

We gonna go and read the javascript file to get the path to the admin site so we can get the next flag, just follow the instruction with and use the debugger in firefox.
Delete a 5 star review to get the next flag.

Open Burpsuite and when u logged in as admin turn on your proxy intercept and click on the basket then you get a request in Burpsuite with the info of /res/basket/1 
and here we change it to 2 and then we got the next flag

7.Where did that come from?

XSS or Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that allows attackers to run javascript in web applications. These are one of the most found bugs in web applications. 
Their complexity ranges from easy to extremely hard, as each web application parses the queries in a different way. 

There are three major types of XSS attacks:

DOM (Special)
DOM XSS (Document Object Model-based Cross-site Scripting) uses the HTML environment to execute malicious javascript. This type of attack commonly uses the <script></script> 
HTML tag.

Persistent (Server-side)
Persistent XSS is javascript that is run when the server loads the page containing it. These can occur when the server does not sanitise the user data when it is uploaded 
to a page. These are commonly found on blog posts. 

Reflected (Client-side)
Reflected XSS is javascript that is run on the client-side end of the web application. These are most commonly found when the server doesn't sanitise search data. 

Type in the following in the search bar : <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"> 
Then you get the first flag.

The second flag we get when we turn on Proxy Intercept and then logout of the admin account.We get the request and add the following line to last line and keep forwarding :
True-Client-IP <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">

Following the instructions to get the third flag,nothing special there.

8.Exploration!

Look up the score-board and get the flag.

Answer:7efd3174f9dd5baa03a7882027f2824d2f72d86e

On the score-board you can see that there are a lot more flags to conquer.

Some more that i found if you are interested :

Download the files from the ftp with the Poison Null Byte %2500.md and look up what it is in the file.
