1.Introduction

This particular room aims to understand the basics of the Burp Suite web application security testing framework. Our focus will 
revolve around the following key aspects:

A thorough introduction to Burp Suite.
A comprehensive overview of the various tools available within the framework.
Detailed guidance on the process of installing Burp Suite on your system.
Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.

2.What is Burp Suite

In essence, Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application 
penetration testing. It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications,
including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).

Simply put, Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This 
fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to 
various components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections. The ability to intercept, view,
and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser 
makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.

3.Features of Burp Community

Although Burp Suite Community offers a more limited feature set compared to the Professional edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. Let's explore some of the key features:

Proxy: The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and 
responses while interacting with web applications.
Repeater: Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. 
This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error 
(e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
Intruder: Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly 
utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
Decoder: Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before 
sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly 
efficient.
Comparer: As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not 
exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard 
shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
Sequencer: Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other 
supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose 
avenues for devastating attacks.

4.Installation

On kali linux it is defaultly installed.You can download it on portswigger.

5.The Dashboard

It shows the Tasks,Issue acitivity,Event Log,Advisory.

Answer:Event Log

6.Navigation

You can click through the Modules on the top bar: Dashboard,Target,Proxy,Intruder,Repeater,Collaborator,Sequencer,Decoder,Comparer
Logger,Organizer,Extensions,Settings

Answer:Proxy Tab

7.Options

There are two types of settings global setting known as user settings and project setting.

Global Settings: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. 
They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suite environment.

Project Settings: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note 
that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close 
Burp.

8.Introduction to the Burp Proxy

The Burp Proxy is a fundamental and crucial tool within Burp Suite. It enables the capture of requests and responses between 
the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, 
or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.

Taking Control: The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it 
invaluable for testing web applications.

Capture and Logging: Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception
is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.

WebSocket Support: Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing 
web applications.

Logs and History: The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs, allowing for 
retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.

9.Connecting trough the Proxy(FoxyProxy)

Follow the instructions how to set up FoxyProxy for BurpSuite and then we can continue.

10.Site Map and Issue Definitions

Turn your configured Proxy on FoxyProxy on and dont forget to connect to the OpenVPN of tryhackme like me.Then visit all links
on the website Bastion Hosting and then look under the Target what it found in the site map.

Thats was it by me.

11.The Burp Suite Browser

Here it is explained that you can use the build in Burp Suite Browser that is based on chromium.

12.Scoping and Targeting

This topic is important since we dont wanna have everything in scope else it gonna be annoying and something always gonna trigger
Burp Suite.

By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to 
target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the Target tab, 
right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting Add To Scope. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether 
we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select yes.

However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we 
need to go to the Proxy settings sub-tab and select And URL Is in target scope from the "Intercept Client Requests" section.

13.Proxying HTTPS

We added the Burp Suite Cert to our Certificate Manager in Firefox.Just follow the instruction.

14.Example Attack

Follow the instruction to modify the email after you put in a legitimate email in the browser then intercept it with Burp
and then we change it to the script attack and get the result.
