2.Introduction

HTTP Service is mostly 80 and HTTPS 443,Windows Netbios 139 and SMB is 445.In CTFs it can be altered so try to enumerate the ports
0-65535(command is -p- so you dont miss maybe some important services.Well known ports are from 0-1024.

Answer:Ports,65535,1024

3.Nmap Switches

4.Scan Types: Overview

Shows you a overview of the scan types.

5.Scan Types: TCP Connect Scans

Well, as the name suggests, a TCP Connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn. 
In other words, Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it 
receives.

In other words, if Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP 
packet with the RST (Reset) flag set. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed.
