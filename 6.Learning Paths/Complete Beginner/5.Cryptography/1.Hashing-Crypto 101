3.Uses for Hashing

Hashing is used for 2 main purposes in Cyber Security. To verify integrity of data (More on that later), or for verifying passwords.

There have been breaches with services that safed the password of there customers in plain text.Thats the worst case when the
passwords get leaked then they can be abused easily.Another breach is when the encryption is really bad and its easy to revert.

open the website crackstation and insert the hash d0199f51d2728db6011945145a1b607a

google for hash analyzer and then insert 5b31f93c09ad1d065c0491b764d04933 you gonna get the info its maybe md5 or md4
then find an online cracker that maybe knows the md5 hash to it or the md4.

4. Recognising password hashes

Prefix	                    Algorithm
$1$	                        md5crypt, used in Cisco stuff and older Linux/Unix systems
$2$, $2a$, $2b$, $2x$, $2y$	Bcrypt (Popular for web applications)
$6$	                        sha512crypt (Default for most Linux/Unix systems)


On this website you can find a lot of example hashes
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes

Find the answers by researching(googling) since you cant know everything. Google for sha512crypt rounds.
Use google to understand the different hashes.

5.Password cracking

Analyze what type this is : $2a$06$7yoU3Ng8dHTXphAg913cyO6Bjs3K5lBnwq5FJyA6d01pMSrddr1ZG
Its bcrypt

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt bcrypthash.txt

Tried to john the following hash too 9eb7ee7f551d2f0ac684981bd1f1e2fa4a37590199636753efe614d4db30e8e1
It didnt work properly so i tried crackstation (website) and then i got a result

The next one i trid again in crackstation and it didnt work so i used again john.
i added the hash into a new txt file with nano newhash1.txt and the hash was :
$6$GQXVvW4EuM$ehD6jWiMsfNorxy5SINsgdlxmAEl3.yif0/c3NqzGLa0P.S7KRDYjycw5bnYkF5ZtB8wQy8KnskuWQS3Yr1wQ0

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt newhash1.txt

For the last hash i used crackstation again.

6.Hashing for integrity checking

Click the link and open the SHA1SUMS and get the first value.

Google hashcat hash modes then you gonna find this cheatsheet and then look up the sha512 with key=$pass

https://github.com/unstable-deadlock/brashendeavours.gitbook.io/blob/master/pentesting-cheatsheets/hashcat-hash-modes.md
There you gonna find the answer for.
