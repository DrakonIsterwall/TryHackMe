1.What will this room cover?

A lot and much is theoretical.

2.Key Terms

Read the terms to understand what terminology is used. 

Passphrase - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.
Well i googled difference of passphrase and password and didnt see such a big difference, maybe i dont find the proper article.
For me its the same do be honest.

Answer:passphrase

3.Why is Encryption important?

Certificates help to prove the identity of a website as example.
There are different compliance standards for banks,consumer websites and much more in this case we take a closer look on PCI-DSS.

Answer:Secure Shell,Certificate,PCI-DSS

4.Crucial Crypto Maths

Use a Python Script or google to get the values calculated.

In computing, the modulo operation returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided 
by another (called the modulus of the operation).

Answer:0,4,3565

5.Types of Encryption

DES has only 56 bits and is NOT considered secure.Triple DES has 112 or 168 and uses the cipher 3 times (thats why its called triple
Des). The succesor is AES.

Answer:Nay,Triple DES,Yea

6.RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman

Its the asymetrical cryptography like using huge numbers to achieve huge factors.
The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, 
the "factoring problem". Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring 
problem is an open question.[3] There are no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used.

7.Establishing Keys Using Asymmetric Cryptography

Get a basic understanding of HTTPS for example.

8.Digital signatures and Certificates

You can get your own HTTPS certificates for domains you own using Let’s Encrypt for free. If you run a website, 
it’s worth setting it up.

Look up the Cert of Tryhackme.

Answer:E1

9.SSH Authentication

Download the files

How do I use these keys?

The ~/.ssh folder is the default place to store these keys for OpenSSH. The authorized_keys (note the US English spelling) file 
in this directory holds public keys that are allowed to access the server if key authentication is enabled. By default on many 
distros, key authentication is enabled as it is more secure than using a password to authenticate. Normally for the root user, 
only key authentication is enabled.

In order to use a private SSH key, the permissions must be set up correctly otherwise your SSH client will ignore the file with 
a warning. Only the owner should be able to read or write to the private key (600 or stricter). ssh -i keyNameGoesHere user@host
is how you specify a key for the standard Linux OpenSSH client.Using SSH keys to get a better shell

SSH keys are an excellent way to “upgrade” a reverse shell, assuming the user has login enabled (www-data normally does not,
but regular users and root will). Leaving an SSH key in authorized_keys on a box can be a useful backdoor, and you don't need to
deal with any of the issues of unstabilised reverse shells like Control-C or lack of tab completion.

12.The Future - Quantum Computers and Encryption

I would say the room was easy and not even close to medium but in total the topic can get really complicated but some understanding
of it can help a lot int CyberSec.
