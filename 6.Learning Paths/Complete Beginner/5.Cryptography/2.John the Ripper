5.Cracking Windows Authentication Hashes

NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in, in short form
NTML.

You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the 
Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- as you can often 
conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.
