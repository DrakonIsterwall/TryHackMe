5.Cracking Windows Authentication Hashes

NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in, in short form
NTML.

You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the 
Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- as you can often 
conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.

Download the hash

change to format=nt

Answer:nt,mushroom

8.Costum Rules

I kinda understand the idea but its the syntax that you probably have to read couple times to use properly then.

Had to lookup the Az"[A-Z]" because i did not understand it properly but after i knew the answer i understood it.
Az appends the "[A-Z]" (in this case all upper letters) to the end of the word.

I looked it up in that link:

Answer:password complexity predictability,Az"[A-Z]",--rule=THMRules

unrar e secure.rar
Then i type in the password i found and save the flag.txt somewhere.
