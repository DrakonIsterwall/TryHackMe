3.Types of Shell

Reverse shells are when the target is forced to execute code that connects back to your computer. On your own computer you would 
use one of the tools mentioned in the previous task to set up a listener which would be used to receive the connection. Reverse 
shells are a good way to bypass firewall rules that may prevent you from connecting to arbitrary ports on the target; however,
the drawback is that, when receiving a shell from a machine across the internet, you would need to configure your own network to 
accept the shell. This, however, will not be a problem on the TryHackMe network due to the method by which we connect into the 
network.

Bind shells are when the code executed on the target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target. 
This would then be opened up to the internet, meaning you can connect to the port that the code has opened and obtain remote code
execution that way. This has the advantage of not requiring any configuration on your own network, but may be prevented by 
firewalls protecting the target.

Answer:R,N,T

4.Netcat

    -l is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener
    -v is used to request a verbose output
    -n tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining this is outwith the scope of the room.
    -p indicates that the port specification will follow.

The example in the previous task used port 443. Realistically you could use any port you like, as long as there isn't already a 
service using it. 
Be aware that if you choose to use a port below 1024, you will need to use sudo when starting your listener. That said, it's often
a good idea to use a well-known port number (80, 443 or 53 being good choices) as this is more likely to get past outbound 
firewall rules on the target.

5.Netcat Shell Stabilisation

Have to write a script or look how to add it properly in my routine or try socat in future.
