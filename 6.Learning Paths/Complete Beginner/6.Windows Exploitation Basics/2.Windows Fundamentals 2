3.Change UAC Settings

The UAC settings can be changed or even turned off entirely (not recommended).

4.Computer Managment

We start with compmgmt.System Tools, Storage, and Services and Applications.

In the task Scheduler we can make Tasks that execute as example script at certain events or times.
Event Viewer allows us to view events that have occurred on the computer. These records of events can be seen as an audit 
trail that can be used to understand the activity of the computer system. This information is often used to diagnose problems 
and investigate actions executed on the system.

Shared Folders is where you will see a complete list of shares and folders shared that others can connect to. 

lusrmgr.msc is for Local User and Groups, we already had this in Windows Fundamentals I.
Perfmon is used to view performance data either in real-time or from a log file. This utility is useful for troubleshooting 
performance issues on a computer system, whether local or remote. (Sounds interesting)

Device Manager allows us to view and configure the hardware, such as disabling any hardware attached to the computer.

Under Storage is Windows Server Backup and Disk Management. We'll only look at Disk Management in this room.
Disk Management is a system utility in Windows that enables you to perform advanced storage tasks.  Some tasks are:

Set up a new drive
Extend a partition
Shrink a partition
Assign or change a drive letter (ex. E:) 

WMI Control configures and controls the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service.

6.Ressource Monitor

In the Overview tab, Resmon has four sections:

    CPU
    Disk
    Network
    Memory

Under this sections we can see a lot of in-depth informations about the system, its good if you need to look into advanced
troubleshooting in a system.

Answer:resmon.exe

7.Command Prompt

In the command prompt we can use simple commands like hostname and whoami,but you can use the system over the cmd if u dont need
a gui.Ipconfig is a often used command.With ipconfig /all we get all infos of the interfaces (in linux it is ifconfig)

The next command is netstat. Per the help manual, this command will display protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network 
connections.In Linux you can use netstat too but you would have to use some options to get a more refined result.

Under this link we find a good list which commands we can use.

Answer:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k %windir%\system32\ipconfig.exe,ipconfig /all

8.Registry Editor

The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:

    Profiles for each user
    Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
    Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
    What hardware exists on the system
    The ports that are being used.

Warning: The registry is for advanced computer users. Making changes to the registry can affect normal computer operations.
