Windows is still the dominating system in both home and corporate networks ( really? i thought many systems use linux in the 
backend.)But yeah Windows was always a target for hackers.

system.Windows 7 was okay but short lifed too and Windows 8.x was out of date quicker as you could spell the word outdated.
Then Windows 10 was published and finally we had a stable and working Windows again. There are 2 different version Home and Pro 
and it the same for Windows 11.

4.The File System

In Windows the file system is using NTFS ( NEw Technolog File System). Before we had FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and 
HPFS(High Performance File System).NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

Supports files larger than 4GB
Set specific permissions on folders and files
Folder and file compression
Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)

You can check what file system your drive is using (mostly NTFS if it is your C:)

On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.
The permissions are:

Full control,Modify,Read & Execute,List folder contents,Read,Write
