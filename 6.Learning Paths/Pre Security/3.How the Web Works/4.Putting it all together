1.Putting it all together

2.Other Components

Load Balancing in this example with round-robin, it checks which of the servers has the least work and send the request then there.
Load Balancers can check on the performance/health of the servers periodically.

CDN (Content Delivery Networks) are like websites that are static and give out different locations/torrents or similiar 
where you can download as example some software.Then you choose the nearest server and it can start downloading or it starts
automatically and chooses the closest server for you.

Databases are storing tons of informations and can have often a high value for hackers because of informations about the customers.

WAF (Web Application Firewall) 
A WAF sits between your web request and the web server; its primary purpose is to protect the webserver from hacking or 
denial of service attacks. It analyses the web requests for common attack techniques, whether the request is from a real 
browser rather than a bot. It also checks if an excessive amount of web requests are being sent by utilising something called
rate limiting, which will only allow a certain amount of requests from an IP per second. If a request is deemed a potential attack,
it will be dropped and never sent to the webserver.

3.How Web Servers Work

Most common server software for wbesites are Apache, Nginx, IIS and NodeJS.

Static and Dynamic Content of Websites
Static content, as the name suggests, is content that never changes. Common examples of this are pictures, javascript, CSS, etc., 
but can also include HTML that never changes. Furthermore, these are files that are directly served from the webserver with 
no changes made to them.

Dynamic content, on the other hand, is content that could change with different requests. Take, for example, a blog. 
On the homepage of the blog, it will show you the latest entries. If a new entry is created, the home page is then updated 
with the latest entry, or a second example might be a search page on a blog. Depending on what word you search, 
different results will be displayed.

Virtual Hosts can make managing of multiple websites easier.
