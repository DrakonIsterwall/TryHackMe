Answer:THM{FIREWALLS_RULE}

4.VPN Basics

A Virtual Private Network (or VPN for short) is a technology that allows devices on separate networks to communicate securely 
by creating a dedicated path between each other over the Internet (known as a tunnel). Devices connected within this tunnel form 
their own private network.

Allows networks in different geographical locations to be connected.Offer Privacy and anonymity.

PPP (Point to Point Protocol) works with a public and private key that must match and CANT leave the network by itself(non-routable)
