1.What are Packets and Frames

Checksum:Checking the integrity of the packets
TTL=Time to live for a packet else the packet would wonder around in the internet for ever and clog it up
Source Address: The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from so that data knows where to return to.
Destination Address: The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.

Answer:Packet,Frame

2.TCP/IP (The Three-Way Handshake)

Source Port:This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly 
            (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).
Destination Port:This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host 
                 (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, 
                 this value is not chosen at random.
Sequence Number:When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number.
Acknowledgement Number:After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data 
                       will have the sequence number + 1. 
Data:This is the header is where the data is.
Flag: his header determines how the packet should be handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flags 
      will determine specific behaviours, which is what we'll come on to explain below.

The Three-way handshake is SYN,SYN/ACK,ACK.
SYN message is used to initiate a connection to synchronize the 2 devices.The SYN/ACK message This packet is sent by the 
receiving device (server) to acknowledge the synchronisation attempt from the client.In the ACK message the connection get then 
acknowledged.

Answer:Checksum,SYN,SYN/ACK,ACK

Answer:THM{TCP_CHATTER}

4.UDP/IP

Request a stream like as example twitch and then it gonna start streaming (responding) to you.
We should recall that UDP is stateless. No acknowledgement is sent during a connection.

Answer:User Datagram Protocol,stateless,TCP,UDP

5.Ports 101 (Practical)

Ports go from 0 - 65535 and the 0-1024 are the common ports and the most known are probably :

FTP 21,SSH 22,HTTP 80,HTTPS 443,SMB(Server Message Block) 445,RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) 3389

Answer:THM{YOU_CONNECTED_TO_A_PORT}
