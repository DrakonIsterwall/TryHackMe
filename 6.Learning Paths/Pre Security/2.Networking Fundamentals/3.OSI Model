1.What is the OSI Model? 

OSI = Open Systems Interconnection Model

I guess everyone that has learned about IT stuff has heared of OSI and probably the TCP/IP Models.
IT is a Model used in networking to explain the fundamentals how data is send,received and how to interpret(understand) the data.

Answers:Open Systems Interconnection Model,7,encapsulation

2.Layer 7 - Application

Good examples so you can understand what the Application Layer is about.
Everyday applications such as email clients, browsers, or file server browsing software such as FileZilla provide a friendly, 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to interact with data sent or received. Other protocols include DNS (Domain Name System), 
which is how website addresses are translated into IP addresses.

Answers:Application,Graphical User Interface

3.Layer 6 - Presentation

This layer translates data to the lowest common form so if it is send the remote pc with maybe a similiar application still 
can use the data.

Good example are emails:
For example, when you send an email, the other user may have another email client to you, but the contents of the email will 
still need to display the same.

4.Layer 5 - Session

The session layer (layer 5) synchronises the two computers to ensure that they are on the same page before data is sent and 
received. Once these checks are in place, the session layer will begin to divide up the data sent into smaller chunks of data 
and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time. This dividing up is beneficial because if the connection is lost, only 
the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to be sent again â€” not the entire piece of the data (think of it as loading a save 
file in a video game).

Answers:Session,Session,Packets

5.Layer 4 - Transport

Here we read about TCP and UDP.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Potentially hinted by the name, this protocol is designed with reliability and guarantee 
in mind. This protocol reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the amount of time it takes for the data to be 
sent and received.Not only this, but TCP incorporates error checking into its design. Error checking is how TCP can guarantee that 
data sent from the small chunks in the session layer (layer 5) has then been received and reassembled in the same order.
TCP is used when we need a reliable connection and cant have some missed data.

UDP is the opposite there is no synchronization before data is sent,no error checking if all packets arrived,can be unstable depending
which way it takes to the receiver.The adavantages are that it is a lot faster and doesnt reserve a connection on the receiving end
and doesnt neeed to have a build up connection constantly.

Its used for streaming or voice over ip (internet protocol) and lot of stuff where it is not important that 100% of the data arrives.

Answers:Transport,Transmission Control Protocol,User Datagram Protocol,TCP,UDP,TCP,TCP,UDP

6.Layer 3 - Network

Answers:Network,Y,Open Shortest Path First,Routing Information Protocol,IP Adresses

7.Layer 2 - Data Link

The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer 
(including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving
endpoint. Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to 
identify it.

Answers:Data Link,Network Interface Card

8.Layer 1 - Physical

Well this is the physical layer,its all about cables and the hardware components needed to connect in networking.

Answers:Physical,Binary,Ethernet Cables
