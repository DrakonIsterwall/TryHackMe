1.Introduction

2.Deploy Your Linux Machine

Deploy and ssh into the Attack Box with password tryhackme and user tryhackme

ssh tryhackme@machine_ip 

3.Terminal Text Editors

create file with nano filename,you can ctrl and use options like ctrl+x to quit nano

Some of VIM's benefits, albeit taking a much longer time to become familiar with, includes:

    Customisable - you can modify the keyboard shortcuts to be of your choosing
    Syntax Highlighting - this is useful if you are writing or maintaining code, making it a popular choice for 
    software developers
    VIM works on all terminals where nano may not be installed
    There are a lot of resources such as cheatsheets, tutorials, and the sorts available to you use.

TryHackMe has a room showcasing VIM if you wish to learn more about this editor!

4.General/Useful Utilities

Downloading Files (Wget)
We're going to cover the use of wget .  This command allows us to download files from the web via HTTP -- as if you 
were accessing the file in your browser. We simply need to provide the address of the resource that we wish to download. 
For example, if I wanted to download a file named "myfile.txt" onto my machine, assuming I knew the web address it -- 
it would look something like this:

wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt

SCP Command
With this information, let's craft our scp command (remembering that the format of SCP is just SOURCE and DESTINATION)

Example from pc to remote pc:
scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt

Example let's reverse this and layout the syntax for using scp to copy a file from a remote computer that we're not logged into 
scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt 

With python3 you can make an easy HTTP Server to have your files where u excecuted the command be available to the be 
downloaded with curl/wget

python3 -m  http.server

When you wanna wget the file then you need to specify the port default is 8000,ip from the machine u started the http server
wget http://MACHINE_IP:8000/myfile

When you wanna be more advanced use updog
https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog

Use Ctrl + C to stop the Python3 HTTPServer module once you are finished.

5.Processes 101

We get to know about the command ps or top and so on they are pretty basic and are fine if thats the only thing u can use
but if u can install software on the machine you are on then i would recommend htop

with systemctl you can start services or stop them.

An Introduction to Backgrounding and Foregrounding in Linux

When u copy a file or download a file that you wanna use later and is not time critical that u need to see when its done,
you can put it in the background so you dont need to open always a new terminal when u start a command that is in the foreground.
Just add & add the and of your command so its run in the background.Ctrl+z you can put a running command in the background

With fg and the id you get when u use the & operator you can bring the command back to the foreground or when you used ctrl+z 
just use the shortcut again.

Answer:301,SIGTERM,THM{PROCESSES},systemctl stop myservice,systemctl enable myservice,fg

6.Maintaining Your System:Automation

read manual of crontab its pretty basic for automation 

Answer:@reboot

7.Maintaining Your System:Package Management

With add-apt-repository you can add more repositories but be aware you could potentially add a repo that is not tested/approved
or probably malicious.
Example how to add a repo.
So, to start, we need to add the GPG key for the developers of Sublime Text 3. (Note that TryHackMe instances do not have 
internet access and so we're not expecting you to add this to the machine that you deploy, as it would fail.)
1. Let's download the GPG key and use apt-key to trust it:  
wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
2. Now that we have added this key to our trusted list, we can now add Sublime Text 3's repository to our apt sources list. 
A good practice is to have a separate file for every different community/3rd party repository that we add.
2.1. Let's create a file named sublime-text.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d and enter the repository information like so
cd into the /etc/apt/sources.list.d and use touch to create a sublime.list file and so on its for debian
deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable
Then use apt update and then you can install sublime with apt install sublime-text

Removing packages is as easy as reversing. This process is done by using the 
add-apt-repository --remove ppa:PPA_Name/ppa command or by manually deleting the file that we previously added to. 
Once removed, we can just use apt remove [software-name-here] i.e. apt remove sublime-text
